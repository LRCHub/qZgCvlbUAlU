You'd be a thorn in my side
Every doctor would break their scalpel
Trying to cut it out
I'd spend my time
Ruining moments you'd share
If they're not mine

Distract them by calling you a liar
While someone's outside popping their tires

If I can't have you, I'll make sure no one will
I'd be beside myself
If I can't have you, I'll make sure no one will
Like a living hell

I'd be the pain in their neck
Every corner they'd do double takes
And look over their shoulder
Make them regret
Every thought that they've had of being with you

You're both out for a night on the town
You get home and the house is burnt down

If I can't have you, I'll make sure no one will
I'd be beside myself
If I can't have you, I'll make sure no one will
Like a living hell

Can I give you a ride back home?
You can tell me where I went wrong
Then I'll promise you that I would never
Let you down again

So if I can't have you, I'll make sure no one will
I'd be beside myself
If I can't have you, I'll make sure no one will
Like a living hell
Like a living hell
Like a living hell

If I can't have you to fill my shoes, I'll make sure no one will
No one will
Like a living hell
