```lrc
[00:08.32] You know I don't believe in ghosts
[00:11.08] Or letting people close
[00:12.97] I'm good at letting go
[00:15.84] You kiss my lips until they're colder
[00:19.26] Think you're in control
[00:20.65] But I should let you know
[00:33.15] 
[00:23.64] Well, the good guys don't always get the glory
[00:27.00] Can't you see the warning signs?
[00:43.00] 
[00:31.86] I can make your life a living hell if I wanted to, wanted to
[00:39.61] Wish this was a love you never felt and you know it's true, know it's true
[00:47.47] Love me, love me
[00:49.13] Trust me with that heart of yours
[00:51.28] Feels so heavy
[00:53.21] Lying on the bedroom floor
[00:55.14] I can make your life a living hell if I wanted to, wanted to
[01:25.14] 
[01:02.82] Chew you up and spit you out
[01:05.32] And still you come around
[01:07.06] So, I can watch you drown
[01:10.56] Hate when you tell me that you'll wait
[01:13.05] Like you think that I could change
[01:14.91] When I've always been this way
[01:29.91] 
[01:17.67] Well, the good guys don't always get the glory
[01:21.22] Can't you see the warning signs?
[01:37.22] 
[01:26.29] I can make your life a living hell if I wanted to, wanted to
[01:33.83] Wish this was a love you never felt and you know it's true, know it's true
[01:41.52] Love me, love me
[01:43.37] Trust me with that heart of yours
[01:45.39] Feels so heavy
[01:47.30] Lying on the bedroom floor
[01:49.31] I can make your life a living hell if I wanted to, wanted to
[02:19.31] 
[01:57.32] I'm haunted by the words you say
[02:00.32] When I can't say that I feel the same
[02:04.00] Admit you'll always be alone
[02:07.29] And baby you should know
[02:09.06] I'm only gonna ghost
[02:19.06] 
[02:12.47] I can make your life a living hell if I wanted to, wanted to
[02:20.45] Wish this was a love you never felt and you know it's true, know it's true (and you know it's true)
[02:27.81] Love me, love me
[02:29.87] Trust me with that heart of yours
[02:31.81] Feels so heavy
[02:33.82] Lying on the bedroom floor
[02:35.65] I can make your life a living hell if I wanted to, wanted to (if I wanted to)
